As a spin off from [Pudding Panic](/portfolio/kunst-stoff/kunst-stoff-gmbh-pudding-panic) PANIC RIDE takes you on a high-speed adventure through the creepy worlds of a haunted house. 

How long can you survive until your jelly faints from fear? Tilt your iPhone/iPad in order to catch the right rail of the tracks, use your crazy super-weapons to scare off monsters along the way, and try to survive for as long as possible!

The idea to spin of Panic Ride as an own game came from a kind of mini game that exists in [Pudding Panic](/portfolio/kunst-stoff/kunst-stoff-gmbh-pudding-panic) and many people in the team thought its quite fun and worthy of an own game so we developed that in parts parralel to [Pudding Panic](/portfolio/kunst-stoff/kunst-stoff-gmbh-pudding-panic) and re used most of the art assets that have been in development anyways to save on costs. 

We also recycled parts of the endless runner type of game play lateron for [Bee With Me](/portfolio/kunst-stoff/kunst-stoff-gmbh-bee-with-me) and of course it also has been developed with [the orkitec game engine](/portfolio/orkitec/orkige-orkitec-game-engine).
