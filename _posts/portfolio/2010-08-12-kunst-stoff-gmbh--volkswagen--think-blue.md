At Kunst-Stoff we produced two interactive Installations for the VW Autostadt in Wolfsburg. 
The first on was an interactive swing wich played animations according to your swinging height and the other one was an interactive Think Blue Symphony.

You can see some pieces of them in <a href="https://vimeo.com/136603212#t=2m25s" target="_blank">this video</a>.

A few years years earlier we also build a iPad App for the inital phases of the Think Blue Campaign wich was actually the first iPad app that has been released utilising [my engine](/portfolio/orkitec/orkige-orkitec-game-engine) wich also has been used for both installations.
