The Periodic Table of the Elements is the constant companion in chemistry lessons. Prepared didactically, this app not only offers the usual data for the elements, but also many clear explanations for the information accessed. If you click on terms in the legend, they are explained. For the groups and periods, the occupation rules for the shell model and the orbital model are explained in detail. 3D models of crystal structures can be rotated and viewed from different angles. Animations can be called up for the radioactive decay types and the physical states. There is a profile for each element in which the most important information is compiled.

The periodic table can be displayed in different views. The fields are colored according to the information in the legend and in the info button i ((in a circle)). The following views can be displayed:

 - ordinal
 - atomic mass
 - density
 - Melting and boiling temperatures
 - Noble, base and semi-precious metals
 - Light and heavy metals
 - electronegativity
 - Atomic and ionic radii
 - shell model
 - orbital model
 - crystal structures
 - Radioactive elements
 - Year of discovery
 - magnetism
