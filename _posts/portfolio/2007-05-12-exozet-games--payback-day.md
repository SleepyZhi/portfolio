Paybackday is not a Released game but just a game prototype that was done at exozet and I was leading the development part of it. It was planned as AAA game for modern consoles  wich meant something like XBox360 at that time. The prototype had nice climbing and fighting mechanics and it was quite a challenge to implemtn them for a small prototype and the graphics where also pretty nice since we had quite good artists in the team. (some of them are also responsible for some current Fortnite Characters) but the game never made it to production.
