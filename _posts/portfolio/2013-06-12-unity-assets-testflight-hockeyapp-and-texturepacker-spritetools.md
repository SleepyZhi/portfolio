Convenient converter that takes SpriteAtlas generated with TexturePacker and converts them to Unity new native 2D SpriteSheets.

Spritesheets can be imported and updated without losing connections of already in use Sprites!

Heavily increases performance especially with the Unity standard version where you donâ€™t have native SpriteEditor support.

Also very helpful for Unity PRO when you want more control on how your atlas is packed.

Works with the Free version of TexturePacker and also with Unity standard version!
