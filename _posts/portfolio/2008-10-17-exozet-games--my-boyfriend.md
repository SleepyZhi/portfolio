I've worked on this game for quite a bit but I forgot most parts about the game wich is probably for the better ... ;) It also has been built with the Vision Game Engine and it had some interesting challenges in terms of AI navigation, a night and day cycle for rendering, a dialog system and several minigames but overall its quite forgettable but a young developer gotta eat...
