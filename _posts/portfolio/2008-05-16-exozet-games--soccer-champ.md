Soccer Champ was the first full game where I was leading and planning the development from beginning to end and I believe its still the only game i ever really finished in the time that was planned. But that was also very important since it was scheduled to release for the soccer championship and delys would have ruined the marketing so the only way we achieved that was cutting away features during the development time when we released we had fallen behind. The game has been build with the vision engine and was a small simulation plus a combination of soccer releated minigames.

*Soccer Champ is aimed at young soccer fans. In the construction simulation, the players have the task of one
To accompany young footballers in his career. The focus is on character development. The
Players can influence the development or success of the character through strategic decisions as well as through action sequences. The focus is on the action sequences.

In Soccer Champ - unlike other soccer simulations - the focus of the game is on the individual
