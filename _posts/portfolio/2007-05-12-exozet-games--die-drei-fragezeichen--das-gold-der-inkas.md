This was the first game I've worked on at exozet and the second proper game in general. At the time I've joined exozet the game already was mostly finished and I just helped out with some bugfixing.

**Position:** Programmer  
**Company:** Exozet Games GmbH  
**Publisher:** United Soft Media Verlag GmbH  
**Platform:** PC  
**Release:** 30. October 2007   
**Info:** [amazon.de](http://www.amazon.de/Die-drei-Das-Gold-Inkas/dp/380324417X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=videogames&qid=1247348975&sr=1-1)


*The three young investigators research the story of an Inca treasure that has disappeared in Rocky Beach and accompany the rescue operation of a sunken ship. In doing so, they are caught in the hands of Panamanian criminals ...
Depending on the situation, the player slips into the role of Justus Jonas, Peter Shaw or Bob Andrews and plays in the 3rd person perspective*
