ChessFinity is a totally new spin on chess. While adapting the rules from the most famous strategy game of all times, ChessFinity adds the thrill of an endless runner. We’ve taken the traditional chessboard and transformed it into a never-ending road to victory. You control one piece from the roster at a time, but you can always swap – from knight to king, from bishop to rook, whatever the situation requires. Try to survive as long as you can and score as many points as possible.

To advance further along the endless road, you have to take all pieces that are sent your way – every piece taken will give you more time and a queen is worth more than a pawn. Analyze your options quickly and then consider those of your opponent – just like chess. But the clock keeps ticking, you have to react fast to keep moving and to beat the high score – as you are competing with players all over the world for the top rank.
