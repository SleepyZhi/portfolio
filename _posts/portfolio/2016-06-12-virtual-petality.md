Unable to have your own pet? Well never fear, as thatâ€™s what Virtual Petality is for. Taking the idea of Nintendogs for VR, Virtual Petality gives you the chance to raise your very own pet dog, feeding it, teaching it tricks and generally just loving it. Moving forward, Orkitec promises to cover an entire range of virtual pet animals. Pet Penguin, anyone?
