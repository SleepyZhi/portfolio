In order to permanently satisfy user demand, today’s mobile apps must be continuously adapted and improved. Bearing in mind that not every user has the same needs. This is where embraase comes in. The Software-as-a-Service solution embraase is targeted at mobile app developers and publishers and enables individual optimization of mobile apps for different user segments. For this purpose, native app elements can be exchanged and adapted with embraase without re-submitting the app. The normally required but time-consuming update process can be skipped completely and the adjustments are injected in real-time into the user´s app.

With embraase all graphic and UI elements such as backgrounds, colours, texts etc. up to entire menu flows can be optimized and adapted as often as necessary. embraase also permits the selective activation and deactivation of whole features. All these adjustments can be target to reach all users or only certain user groups. Practically, the team has identified two use cases that they will focus on initially: A/B testing, i.e. the data-supported optimization through simultaneous testing of several variations directly on the user, and personalization, the targeted supply of individually adapted content to different user groups.
