"Help an anxious pudding who got lost in a haunted house, save him from the terrible monsters, and be careful that he does not lose his courage during his escape!"

As special as this description reads itself as special is the game. Pudding Panic was the first big indy game production from kunst-stoff meaning it was not created with any publisher funding and involvement. The game was targeted for mobile devices but later also released for Mac and PC and again has been built with my [orkige engine](/portfolio/orkitec/orkige-orkitec-game-engine). Since I was development director I was planning out tasks and todos but also was evelved in the game design and especially do-ability of its features.

 The game had a very dark and unique art style and we had a lot of very talented people involved in the design and development process. 
 
 The game to date has received excellent reviews (see the [game’s website](http://www.thegreatjitters.com/pudding_panic.html)) and was promoted as “GAME OF THE WEEK” on the App Store. Right at the date of release, the game was recommended as “new and noteworthy” by the App Store in many countries. The game was on position 5 of the list “All games 2011” on metacritic.com!

To a certain extent the game design also has been a continuation of the puzzle game concept that [kunst-stoff](/portfolio/kunst-stoff/) invented in [Galaxy Racers](/portfolio/kunst-stoff/kunst-stoff-gmbh-galaxy-racers).
