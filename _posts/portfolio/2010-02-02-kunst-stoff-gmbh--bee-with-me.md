*Bee With Me* has been developed as an accompanying game to the film documentary ‘More than Honey‘ and takes the player through the microcosm of bees and shows what risks of the current widespread deaths of bees entail for our planet in a playful manner. 
Its a kind of endless runner so we could re use several things we had in development for [Panic Ride](/portfolio/kunst-stoff/kunst-stoff-gmbh-panic-ride) already and the game also has been devloped with the [orkitec game engine](/portfolio/orkitec/orkige-orkitec-game-engine).
