I've studied computerscience in merseburg germany with the main topics Networks, AI and media something like a century ago. I've built my first small games during that time as well and I'll try to dig them out from some old hard drives just to showcase the very early stuffs :D.

To make some money since you're always broke as a student I've worked as c++ programmer in a companiy that made a sheduling software for machines with some sap interfaces. My first task was to write a java applet web interface for this and later i was working on c++ serialization wich was quite interesting since i could transfer some of the learnings into later game development projects.

Later i was also working as php web developer in a company where I also had planned and even started to write my diploma thesis but in some stage of internal restructuring the company decided it couldn't pay its students anymore and while they left me the option to stay there unpaid and finish my theses I decided to "f*ck this I hate you all anyways" and to try to pursue my passion and search throughout germany for a company that would want to hire a student for an interesting game development related thesis.

It took around 100 applications since many companies did not wanted to pay for students but finally i found a gig at the rotobee realtime 3d gmbh and wrote my thesis around building a online multiplayer framework.
