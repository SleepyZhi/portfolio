Payleven was a mobile payment provider founded in 2012 with headquarters in Berlin and London. Payleven has enabled merchants to process debit and credit card payments using their smartphones or tablets. The fintech startup was active in ten European countries: in addition to Germany and Great Britain, also in Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria, Poland and Spain. In 2012 Payleven expanded to Brazil. In April 2016 Payleven merged with its competitor Sumup and payleven as a brand was discontinued.

I've started as lead developer for the iOS team but soon also took over android and became lead developer for the whole mobile department. I managed to align certain parts of the quite diverted development strands since new cardreaders and other technologies needed to be integratable into both platforms quickly. I was new to the payments industry and learned a lot in a short amount of time. 
Payleven did grow quick and aggressively as most of the [rocket-internet](/portfolio/rocket-internet/) companies at that time since they wanted to quickly "win" certain countries. I was only there for a year but elevated my experiences notably in things I would try to bring in my [my own company](/portfolio/mbaas-development/) which I founded directly afterwards but also things that I would not want todo the same way.
