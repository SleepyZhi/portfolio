When I planned out my goals for 2020 video played a big role in it since I want to try to create regular youtube videos of how-to's that I post in the [blog](/blog/) as well as [devlogs](/blog/devlogs/) and the likes but I also wanted to try to host regular dev livestreams.
For that you obviously need a camera connected to your computer and the only one i had was the facetime cam on my macbook and while its supposedly a good integrated webcam the camera angle sucks and the quality isn't all to great but I also own an iPhone XS  which should have a pretty good integrated cam so I went on a journey to find out how to use it as a webcam  or more precisely a streaming camera.

Its by far not as straight forward as i would have hoped and I'm no yet really satisfied with my solution but at least it works and the quality is better then a regular which I also tried out.
