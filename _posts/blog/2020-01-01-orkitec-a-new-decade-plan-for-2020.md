The last years have been quite intense but In the past a rarely shared anything about my professional or hobby indie gamedev stuff endeavours. I read, watch and follow the progress of several indie devs and always find it quite motivating so for 2020 I decided to share more about my ongoing process and progress since I also decided to work on a new game.
So far I have retrospectively written devlogs summarizing the happenings of [2019](/blog/devlog/orkitec-devlog-2019) and [2018](/blog/devlog/orkitec-devlog-2018) as well as some basics information for all [past projects](/portfolio/) but there is much more to come it just takes quite a bunch of time doing all this content.
