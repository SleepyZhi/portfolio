	<p>
		Orkitec is a solo independent developer from Berlin founded by me (Steffen RÃ¶mer) in 2009 around the same time that I've joined <a href="/portfolio/kunst-stoff">kunst-stoff</a>. It was offical registered because I wanted to release a game in the apple appstore and needed a legal entity for this. I also wanted to try to license my <a href="/portfolio/orkitec/orkige-orkitec-game-engine">game engine</a> that I've already worked on for a few years as a hobby and learning project for myself. Over the past 10+ years orkitec released several games, apps and plugins.
