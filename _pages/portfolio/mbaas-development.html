	<p>
		In 2013 I founded Mbaas Development together with Christian Stanke a friend and former colleague from <a href="/portfolio/kunst-stoff">Kunst-Stoff</a>. Originally we wanted to start a mobile game studio but through research for the needed tools our plan pivoted into building the mobile backend as a service platform <a href="/portfolio/mbaas-development/embraase">embraase</a> wich later evolved into the software localization platform <a href="/portfolio/mbaas-development/applanga">Applanga</a>. To bootstrap the company before funding and customers we also did contract development for a <a href="/portfolio/mbaas-development/westermann-periodic-table-of-the-elements">periodic table app</a> and a <a href="/portfolio/mbaas-development/die-gro%C3%9Fe-woerterfabrik">digital children book</a> in Unity. At the the end of 2018 we sold the <b>Mbaas Development GmbH</b> to <a href="https://www.transperfect.com" target="_blank">Transperfect</a> <i>"the largest privately owned language services provider, with offices in over 100 cities worldwide"</i> and are still leading Applanga's development and operations as main daily jobs.
