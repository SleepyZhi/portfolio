An ork who is an architect?

Something with dragons?

Hi I'm Steffen and this website is a reflection of my past projects, current endeavours, tutorials.    
The name does not stand for anything specific but is just an abbrevation of a nickname I used ages ago and I picket it when it was officially registered as a business.
orkitec is not my fulltime job since during the day I've built and still co-manage a software localization platform called [portfolio](/portfolio/mbaas-development/Applanga).
Most of the website content is about my solo indie gamedevlopment side huzzle with [orkitec](/portfolio/orkitec) but also a [portfolio](/portfolio/) collection of projects I worked on outside the frame of orkitec.
Additionally there is a [Blog](/blog/) with tutorials and a [Devlog](/blog/devlog/) with ongoing development process.
