## What does orkitec stand for?

An ork who is an architect?    
Technology from planet ork?   
Something with dragons?   

The name actually does not stand for anything specific it originated of a nickname I used ages ago and I picket it when I officially registered as a business.

## What orkitec is and what it is not?

Most of what happens under the orkitec brand is in some way related to indie game development and an occasional app or service here and there. You can find more details about [orkitec projects here](/portfolio/orkitec).
orkitec is not my full time job since during the day I've built and co-manage the software localization platform and company [Applanga](/portfolio/mbaas-development/Applanga).

## What is this site about?

Most of the content here is about my solo indie gamedevlopment side huzzle with [orkitec](/portfolio/orkitec) but also a [portfolio](/portfolio/) collection of other projects I worked on, a [blog](/blog/) with tutorials and a [devlog](/blog/devlog/) with ongoing development progress.
